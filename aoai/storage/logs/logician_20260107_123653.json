  "steps": [
    "Imagine a curve on a graph, and a point moving along this curve, the derivative measures how fast the curve is rising or falling at that point.",
    "Visualize a tangent line to the curve at the point of interest, the slope of this tangent line represents the instantaneous rate of change of the curve.",
    "As the point moves along the curve, the slope of the tangent line changes, the derivative is a function that describes this changing slope at each point on the curve.",
    "Think of the derivative as a measure of the curve's steepness at a given point, with higher values indicating a steeper slope and lower values indicating a gentler slope."
