    "Imagine a curve on a graph, where each point represents the relationship between two variables, and think of the derivative as a measure of how steep this curve is at any given point.",
    "To visualize this, consider a tangent line that just touches the curve at a single point, representing the instantaneous rate of change at that point.",
    "The derivative is then the slope of this tangent line, which can be thought of as the rate at which one variable changes when the other variable changes by a very small amount."
